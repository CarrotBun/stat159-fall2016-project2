#Predicting Credit Balance  

##Synopsis  
This project's goal is to predict the average balance that the customer has remaining on their credit card after making their monthly payment. We use methods of regressions such as OLS, Ridge, Lasso, PCR, and PLSR, and cross validation to select the best model of prediction. 

##Motivation  
The motivation for this is to see if factors such as income, credit limit, rating, cards, age, gender, student status, marital status, and ethnicity would affect and predict credit balance. 

##Installation  
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

##Tests  
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
