## Data

The credit data used in this project includes both categorical and quantitative data.   

Quantitative variables are  

* Income
* Limit
* Rating
* Cards: Number of Credit Cards
* Age
* Education(years), and
* Balance

and Categorical variables include  

* Gender: Female or Male
* Student: Yes or No
* Married: Yes or No, and
* Ethnicity: African, American, Asian, or Caucasian

To take a closer look at each variables included in the **Credit** dataset, we looked at the distributions of each quantitative variable (Figures 1 and 2) and the conditional distribution of each categorical variable against Balance (Figure 4).

As shown through the historgrams, the distribution of Incomes, Limits, Ratings, # of cards, and balances are slightly skewed to the right. A possible explanation for the similar distribution could be that all five factors are highly correlated -- Individuals with higher incomes are more likely to have higher credit limit, better rating, and more credit cards. 





Distribution of categorical variables is shown below in Figure 4.
